# Implementation of searching techniques (Sequential search, Binary search)
## Sequential Search
**Algorithm seqSearch (list, last, target, locn)**
*Purpose:* Locate the target in an unordered list of elements.
*Pre:* list must contain at least one element
	last is index to last element in the list target contains the data to be
	located locn is address of index in calling algorithm
*Post:* if found: index stored in locn & found true if not found: last stored in
	locn & found false Return found true or false

1. set looker to 0
2. loop (looker < last AND target not equal list[looker])
	1. increment looker
3. end loop
4. set locn to looker
5. if (target equal list[looker])
	1. set found to true
6. else
	1. set found to false
7. end if
8. return found
end **seqSearch**

**Algorithm recursiveSeqSearch(list, index, last, locn, target)**
*Purpose:* Locate the target in an unordered list of elements.
*Pre:* list must contain at least one element
	index is the first element in the list
	last is index to last element in the list target contains the data to be located
	locn is address of index in calling algorithm
*Post:* if found: index stored in locn & found true if not found: last stored in
	locn & found false Return found true or false
1. if(index>last)
	1. locn=-1
	2. return flase
2. end if
3. if(target==list[index])
	1.locn= index
	2.return true
4. end if
5. return recursiveSeqSearch (list, index+1, last, locn, target)
**End recursiveSeqSearch**

## Binary Search
**Algorithm binarySearch (list, last, target, locn)**
*Purpose:* Search an ordered list using Binary Search
*Pre:* list is ordered; it must have at least 1 value
	last is index to the largest element in the list
	target is the value of element being sought
	locn is address of index in calling algorithm
*Post:* if target found: locn assigned index to target element
	if target not found: locn assigned element below or above target
*Return :* found as true or false

1. set begin to 0
2. set end to last
3. loop (begin <= end)
	1. set mid to (begin + end) / 2
	2. if (target > list[mid])
		1.set begin to (mid + 1)
	3. else if (target < list[mid])
		1.set end to mid - 1
	4. else
		1.set begin to (end + 1)
	5. end if
4. end loop
5. set locn to mid
6. if (target equal list [mid])
	1. set found to true
7. else
	1. set found to false
8. end if
9. return found
**end binarySearch**
**Algorithm recursiveBinarySearch (list, first, last, target, locn)**
*Purpose:* Search an ordered list using Binary Search
*Pre:* list is ordered; it must have at least 1 value
	first is index to the smallest element in the list
	last is index to the largest element in the list
	target is the value of element being sought
	locn is address of index in calling algorithm
*Post:* if target found: locn assigned index to target element
	if target not found: locn assigned element below or above target
*Return :* found as true or false

1. if last > first then
	1.locn=-1
	2.return false
2. else
	1. mid = (first + last) / 2
	2. if target< list[mid] then
		1. return recursiveBinarySearch (list, first, mid-1, target,locn)
	3. else if target >list[mid] then
		1. return recursiveBinarySearch (list, mid+1, last, target,locn)
	4. else
		1. locn=mid
		2. return true
	5. end if
3. end if
**end recursiveBinarySearch**
